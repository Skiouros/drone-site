	<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Dear visitor,</p><br />
<p>Welcome to TravelByDrone! We want to give you the chance to discover the world from the perspective of drones. The video footage of the area you are most interested in is as accessible as never before.</p>
<p>On this site, everyone can share YouTube or Vimeo videos and add the corresponding location. The videos will appear on the map with a pin where the video footage has been recorded. After submitting a request to share a video, a dedicated team will review the material before validating the request. As soon as the request has been validated, the shared video will be visible on the map.</p>
<p>For a share request to be validated, the video needs to be taken by a drone (not of a drone), be of high quality and clearly show the area in which the drone flies. A video will not be accepted if it is from a military drone or is of promotional nature (promoting a product or has a political, religious or other personal message).</p>
<p>TravelByDrone.com does not host any videos. If you have any issues with a video please contact the owner on www.youtube.com&nbsp;or www.vimeo.com. If you are the owner of a video and do not wish your video to be shared on the internet, please adjust your video settings.</p>
<p>The TravelByDrone team.</p></div>
